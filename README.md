A simple Flask application that gets basic weather data for my neighorhood in the Bronx from the Open-Meteo API and displays it in a table format. 
Additionally, it loads this data into a serverless Postgres instance on Neon. 
Lastly, it contains a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file allowing for the application to be run on a container.
